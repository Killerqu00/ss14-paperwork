Little is known about Curators. This is not a corporation, not a cult - it's a group of seemingly unrelated people. Some people make theories that these people are the ones who pull the strings that are attached to every high-ranking individual in the world. Some Curators work as regular people undercover on a station, some live in giant mansions completely alone, some of them are even criminals - however, never for anything violent, like killing yet another captain of another station. 
The proclaimed goal of the Curator Order is simple: "Experience of sentient beings is to be preserved by any cost". This phrase is known by each and every Curator, no matter where. No one, except the Curators themselves, know who (or what?) was the first source of this phrase. This, however, is the only law that Curators follow above all. 
There is no known way of becoming a Curator. It is not an organisation, since there are no leaders - each and every Curator is equal, although they do have differences in power. There are rumours that Curators are appointed only as a blessing from God of Wisdom as their Emanators. However, this is not confirmed at all.
One of the most known Emanators of Wisdom (this is the way believers in Wisdom God call the Curators) is Duke Charles XLII, ruler of Perlivia. His success at turning Perlivia into one of the most populated planets in Known Space. His library is the biggest known source of any knowledge in all of the Known Space, and for that reason, this place is considered an unofficial meeting point for Curators and those who follow the will of Wisdom God.
Even though Curators usually try to pursue their goals by peaceful contacts, they are still a force to be reckoned with. Technology made using blueprints invented or discovered by Curators is considered to be the best available. There is a saying that goes: "If something exists, there is a Curator that knows everything about it.
